      description: |-
        This endpoint logs out the current session by invalidating the session cookie. Upon successful logout, a response with status `200 OK` is returned, and the session is closed.
        
        The client must provide the session cookie (`id`) to log out successfully. Once the session is terminated, the user will need to log in again to access protected resources.
